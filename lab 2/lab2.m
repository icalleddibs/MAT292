%% Integrator Lab: Solving First Order ODEs in MATLAB and Picard Approximation
%
% This lab will teach you to numerically solve first order ODEs using a
% built in MATLAB integrator, |ode45|.  |ode45| is a good, general purpose
% tool for integrating first order equations (and first order systems).  It
% is not always the right algorithm, but it is usually the right algorithm
% to try first. This lab will also teach you how to manipulate symbolic
% functions in MATLAB.
%
% You will learn how to use the |ode45| routine, how to interpolate between
% points, and how MATLAB handles data structures.  You will also learn how
% to use MATLAB for exact symbolic calculations and write your own Picard
% approximation code.
% 
% Opening the m-file lab2.m in the MATLAB editor, step through each
% part using cell mode to see the results.  Compare the output with the
% PDF, which was generated from this m-file.
%
% There are eight exercises in this lab that are to be handed in at the
% end of the lab.  Write your solutions in the template, including
% appropriate descriptions in each step. Save the .m file and submit it 
% online using Quercus.

%% Set up an inline function representation of an ODE and solve it
%
% MATLAB has many built in routines for solving differential equations of
% the form
%
% |y' = f(t,y)|
%
% We will solve them using |ode45|, a high precision integrator.  To do
% this, we will need to construct an inline function representation of |f|,
% an initial condition, and specify how far we want MATLAB to integrate the
% problem.  Once we have set these, we pass the information to |ode45| to
% get the solution.
%
% For a first example, we will solve the initial value problem
%
% |y' = y, y(0) = 1|
%
% which has as its answer |y = e^t|. 
%
%

% Set up the right hand side of the ODE as an inline function
f = @(t,y) y; 

% The initial conditions
t0 = 0;
y0 = 1;

% The time we will integrate until
t1 = 2;

soln = ode45(f, [t0, t1], y0);


%% Examining the output
%
% When we execute the |ode45|, it returns a data structure, stored in soln.
% We can see the pieces of the data structure with a display command:

disp(soln);

%% Understanding the components of the solution data structure
%
% The most important elements of the data structure are stored in the |x|
% and |y| components of the structure; these are vectors.  Vectors |x| and
% |y| contain the points at which the numerical approximation to the
% initial value problem  has been computed.  In other words, |y(j)| is the
% approximate value of the solution at |x(j)|.
%
% *NOTE:* Even though we may be studying a problem like |u(t)| or |y(t)|,
% MATLAB will always use |x| for the independent variable and |y| for the
% dependent variable in the data structure.
%
% Pieces of the data structure can be accessed using a period, as in C/C++
% or Java.  See the examples below:

% Display the values of |t| at which |y(t)| is approximated
fprintf(' Vector of t values: ');
disp(soln.x);
% Display the the corresponding approximatations of |y(t)|
fprintf(' Vector of y values: ');
disp(soln.y);

% Display the approximation of the solution at the 3rd point:
fprintf(' Third element of the vector of t values: %g\n',soln.x(3));
fprintf(' Third element of the vector of y values: %g\n',soln.y(3));


%% Visualizing and comparing the solution
% We can now visualize the solution at the computed data points and compare
% with the exact solution.

% Construct the exact solution
tt = linspace(0,2,50);
yy = exp(tt);

% Plot both on the same figure, plotting the approximation with x's
plot(tt, yy, soln.x, soln.y, 'x', 'MarkerSize',10, 'LineWidth', 2);
% NOTE: the MarkerSize and LineWidth are larger than their defaults of 6
% and 1, respectively.  This makes the print out more readable.

% Add a label to the axis and a legend
xlabel('t');
legend('Exact', 'Numerical','Location','Best');

%% Exercise 1
%
% Objective: Solve an initial value problem and plot both the numerical
% approximation and the corresponding exact solution.
%
% Details: Solve the IVP
%
% |y' = y tan t + sin t, y(0) = -1/2|
%
% from |t = 0| to |t = pi|.
%
% Compute the exact solution (by hand), and plot both on the same figure
% for comparison, as above.
%
% Your submission should show the construction of the inline function, the
% use of ode45 to obtain the solution, a construction of the exact
% solution, and a plot showing both.  In the comments, include the exact
% solution.
%
% Label your axes and include a legend.

% Inline function of the right hand side
f = @(t,y) y.*tan(t) + sin(t); 

t0 = 0;
y0 = -1/2;
t1 = pi;

soln1 = ode45(f, [t0, t1], y0);

tt = linspace(0,pi,50);
yy = -0.5.*cos(tt);

plot(tt, yy, soln1.x, soln1.y, '+', 'MarkerSize',10, 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('t');
ylabel('y');
legend('Exact', 'Numerical','Location','NorthWest');

%general solution is y = Csec(t) - 1/2 * cos(t)
%particular solution has C = 0, so y = -1/2 * cos(t)

%% Computing an approximation at a specific point
%
% As you should be able to see by examining |soln.x|, ode45 returns the
% solution at a number of points between |t0| and |t1|.  But sometimes we
% want to know the solution at some intermediate point.
%
% To obtain this value, we need to interpolate it in a consistent way.
% Fortunately, MATLAB provides a convenient function, |deval|, specifically
% for this.

% Compute the solution at t = .25:
deval(soln, .25)

% Compute the solution at t = 1.6753:
fprintf(' Solution at 1.6753: %g\n', deval(soln, 1.6753));

% Compute the solution at 10 grid points between .45 and 1.65:
tinterp = linspace(.45, 1.65, 10);
deval(soln, tinterp)

% Alternatively:
deval(soln, linspace(.45, 1.65, 10))


%% Exercise 2
% 
% Objective: Interpolate a solution at a number of grid points
%
% Details: For the solution you computed in exercise 1, use deval to
% compute the interpolated values at 10 grid points between 2 and 3.

fprintf('Solutions of exercise 1 from 2 to 3: ');
deval(soln1, linspace(2, 3, 10))

%% Errors, Step Sizes, and Tolerances
%
% As you may have noticed, in contrast to the IODE software, at no point do
% we set a step size for our solution.  Indeed, the step size is set
% adaptively to conform to a specified error tolerance.  
%
% Roughly speaking, given the solution at |(t_j, y_j)|, |ode45| computes two
% approximations of the solution at |t_{j+1} = t_j + h|; one is of greater
% accuracy than the other.  If the difference is below a specified
% tolerance, the step is accepted and we continue.  Otherwise the step is
% rejected and the smaller step size, |h|, is used; it is often halved.
%
% We can compute the global truncation error at each solution point, figure
% out the maximum error, and visualize this error (on a linear-log scale):

% Compute the exact solution
yexact = exp(soln.x);

% Compute the pointwise error; note the use of MATLAB's vectorization
err = abs(yexact - soln.y);

disp(err);

fprintf('maximum error: %g \n', max(err));

semilogy(soln.x, err, 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('t');
ylabel('error');


%% Exercise 3
%
% Objective: Examine the error of a solution generated by |ode45|
%
% Details: For your solution to exercise 1, compute the pointwise error,
% identify the maximum value of the error, and visualize the error on a 
% linear-log plot (use semilogy to plot the log of the error vs. t).  
% Write in the comments where the error is largest, and give a brief 
% (1-2 sentences) explanation of why it is largest there.  Make sure to 
% label your axes.

yexact1 = -0.5.*cos(soln1.x);
err1 = abs(yexact1 - soln1.y);
disp(err1);

fprintf('maximum error: %g \n', max(err1));
semilogy(soln1.x, err1, 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('t');
ylabel('Error of Exercise 1');

%the error is largest at t = 1.55881s, which is very close to pi/2, at
%which the function goes to 0 as predicted. when plotting the direction
%field in IODE, we can see that the function y'=y*tan(t)+sin(t) has a
%vertical asymptote at pi/2. This shows that the slope is changing
%extremely quickly, which would make it difficult to approximate. Thus,
%because the point t=1.55881 is very close to the vertical asymptote, the
%program produces a large amount of error.

%% Exercise 4
%
% Objective: Solve and visualize a nonlinear ode using ode45
%
% Details: Solve the IVP
%
% |y' = 1 / y^2 , y(1) = 1|
%
% from |t=1| to |t=10| using |ode45|.  Find the exact solution and compute
% the maximum pointwise error.  Then plot the approximate solution and the
% exact solution on the same axes.
%
% Your solution should show the definition of the inline function,
% the computation of its solution in this interval, the computation of the
% exact solution at the computed grid points, the computation of the
% maximum error, and a plot of the exact and approximate solutions.
%Your axes should be appropriately labeled and include a legend.

% Inline function
f = @(t,y) 1 ./ (y.^2); 

t0 = 1;
y0 = 1;
t1 = 10;

%approximate solution
soln2 = ode45(f, [t0, t1], y0);

%exact solution
tt2 = linspace(1,10,50);
yy2 = (3.*tt2-2).^(1./3);

plot(tt2, yy2, soln2.x, soln2.y, '+', 'MarkerSize',10, 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('t');
ylabel('y');
legend('Exact', 'Numerical','Location','NorthWest');

% error calculations
yexact2 = (3.*soln2.x-2).^(1./3);
err2 = abs(yexact2 - soln2.y);
disp(err2);

fprintf('maximum error: %g \n', max(err2));

%% Exercise 5
%
% Objective: Solve and visualize an ODE that cannot be solved by hand with
% |ode45|.
%
% Details: Solve the IVP
%
% |y' =  1 - t y / 2, y(0) = -1|
%
% from |t=0| to |t=10|.  
%
% Your solution should show you defining the inline function, computing
% the solution in this interval, and plotting it.
%
% Your axes should be appropriately labeled

f = @(t,y) 1 - (t .* y ./ 2); 

t0 = 0;
y0 = -1;
t1 = 10;

%approximate solution
soln3 = ode45(f, [t0, t1], y0);

plot(soln3.x, soln3.y, '-', 'MarkerSize', 10, 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('t');
ylabel('y');
legend('Numerical','Location','Best');

%% Exercise 6 - When things go wrong
%
% Objective: Solve an ode and explain the warning message
%
% Details: Solve the IVP:
%
% |y' = y^3 - t^2, y(0) = 1|
%
% from |t=0| to |t=1|.  
%
% Your solution should show you defining the inline function, and computing
% the solution in this interval.
% 
% If you try to plot the solution, you should find that the solution does
% not make it all the way to t = 1.
%
% In the comments explain why MATLAB generates the warning message that you
% may see, or fails to integrate all the way to t=1.  HINT: Try plotting
% the direction field for this with IODE.

f = @(t,y) y.^3 - t.^2;

t0 = 0;
y0 = 1;
t1 = 1;

soln4 = ode45(f, [t0, t1], y0);

plot(soln4.x, soln4.y, '-', 'MarkerSize', 10, 'LineWidth', 2);
xlabel('t');
ylabel('y');
legend('Numerical','Location','Best');

% the warning is: "Warning: Failure at t=5.066046e-01.  Unable to meet
% integration tolerances without reducing the step size below the smallest
% value allowed (1.776357e-15) at time t."

% using the direction fields of IODE of this differential equation's
% solutions, we can see that the slope tends towards becoming infinite,
% suggesting a vertical asymptote/equilibrium around t = 0.5066 (as shown
% in the error of where failure occurs). this means that this particular
% solution will never pass t ~= 0.51, and definitely not up to t=1, which
% is why ode45 and the graph fails to integrate up to t=1 for this IVP.

%% Using symbolic variables to define functions
% We can define symbolic variables to let MATLAB know that these variables
% will be used for exact computations

% Start by defining the variables as symbolic
syms t s x y

% Define a function by simply writing its expression

f = cos(t)
g = sin(t)
h = exp(2*x)

% We can manipulate these functions

simplify(f^2+g^2)
diff(h) %differentiates the function

% We can plot a function defined symbolically using the command |ezplot|.
% Learn about the command |ezplot|:

help ezplot

% Plot the function |f(t)| and |h(x)|

ezplot(f)
ezplot(h)

%%
% If we try to evaluate the function |f(0)|, we get an error message. 
%
% The symbolic variables are not meant to be used to evaluate functions,
% but to manipulate functions, compute derivatives, etc.
% To evaluate a function using symbolic variables is a little cumbersome:

% We need to substitute the variable by a value:

subs(f,t,pi)

%%
% This expression means: In the expression |f|, substitute the variable |t|
% by the number |pi|.

% If we use a value where the cosine does not have a "nice" expression, we
% need to approximate the result:

subs(f,t,2) %says cos(2)

% We need to use the command |eval|

eval(subs(f,t,2)) %gives approx answer -0.4161


%% Exercise 7
% Objective: Define a function using symbolic variables and manipulate it.
%
% Details: Define the function |f(x) = sin(x)cos(x)|
%
% Use MATLAB commands to obtain a simpler form of this function, compute
% value of this function for |x=pi/4| and |x=1|, and plot its graph.

syms x;

g = sin(x);
h = cos(x);
f = simplify(g.*h)

ezplot(f);
subs(f, x, pi./4)
eval(subs(f, x, 1))
ylabel('f(x)');

%% Obtaining Picard approximations 
%
% Consider an initial value problem
%
% |y' = 1 + y|
% |y(0) = 0|
%
% First we need to define the variables we will be using

syms t s y;

% We then need to define the function f

f = 1+y; % we define it without the @(t,y) because it is a symbolic function

% We set up our initial approximation phi_0 = 0:

phi=[sym(0)];   % we will keep a list with all the approximations

% Set up a loop to get successive approximations using Picard iterations

N=5;

for i = 1:N
    func=subs(f,y,phi(i));    % prepare function to integrate: y -> previous phi
    func=subs(func,t,s);      % variable of integration is s, so we need to change
                              % t -> s
    
    newphi = int(func, s, 0 ,t);   % integrate to find next approximation

    
    phi=cat(2,phi,[newphi]);       % update the list of approximations by adding new phi
end

% Show the last approximation

phi(N+1)

% Plot the approximation just found

picard=ezplot(phi(N+1),[0,5]);
set(picard,'Color','green');         % set the color of the graph to green

% In this case, the exact solution is
%
% |y=e^t-1|
%
% Compare the approximation and the exact solutions

hold on;
exact=ezplot(exp(t)-1,[0,5]);

%  exact solution.
%
%  Details: Consider the IVP
%     | y' = 1+y^2|
%     | y(0) = 1 |
%
% Find the Picard approximation phi_5. 
% For better efficiency, do not keep all the previous approximations.
%
% Compute the exact solution (by hand), and plot both on the same figure
% for comparison, as above.
%
% Label your axes and include a legend.
%
% HINT. The initial condition has 1 instead of 0, so the Picard
% method needs to be adapted.

syms t s y; 

f = 1 + y.^2; 
phi = [sym(1)]; %starting point

N = 5; 

for i = 1:N
       func= subs(f, y, phi(i));
